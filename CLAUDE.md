# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

This is a freshly initialized development workspace currently containing only Claude Code configuration files. The repository is set up with basic Claude permissions for file system operations.

## Current Structure

The repository contains:
- `.claude/` - Claude Code configuration directory
  - `settings.local.json` - Local permissions configuration allowing basic file operations

## Development Environment

### Permissions
The current Claude configuration allows:
- Basic file system operations (`find`, `ls`)
- Standard development commands

### Getting Started
This appears to be a new development workspace. Common next steps would be:
1. Initialize a project with appropriate package managers
2. Set up development tools and dependencies
3. Create initial project structure

## Notes

This is a minimal workspace setup. As the project develops, this documentation should be updated to reflect:
- Build and development commands
- Project architecture and structure
- Testing procedures
- Deployment processes
